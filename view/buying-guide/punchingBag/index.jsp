        While shadow boxing or forms of doing techniques "in the air" will give you a bit of cardiovascular work-out, depending on your effort â€“ and such activities do burn movement into muscle memory, the brain, and neural- pathways- it is still good to be able to hit something which has resistance, to get the body used to the shock of making contact with an actual solid object. As boxers and other fighters need to use punching bags, before you go out and buy one for yourself, these are few types of punching bags you'd want to know about:

        TYPES OF PUNCHING BAGS
    </h3>

    <h4 class="lp_subHeadingImg lp_bold">
        HEAVY BAGS
    </h4>
    <p class="lp_smallText">
        Heavy bags are hung from wall-mounted brackets and they feature a free-standing system. They are cylindrical and are made from tough-wearing leather which comes in various sizes and weights. These come with a set of chains or toughened straps. The heavy bags allows you to use different styles and techniques, either moving side to side and pinging off the jabs, right crosses and other long range punches, or stepping close and using crunching short range hooks and short range uppercuts.

        SPEED BAGS
    </h4>
    <p class="lp_smallText">
        Speed bags are designed to help develop your slipping, ducking and rolling skills. They're tear-drop shaped and filled with maize. They come in either a small or a large size that weighs 15 kg or 30 kg+ respectively.
        Teardrop shaped punching bags are great for developing quickness for boxing, kickboxing and mixed martial arts, due to their unique shape and light weight compared to other kinds of bags. Teardrop bags can be hung in ways that will allow for drills in both punching and kicking, as well as Muay thai moves.

        ANGLED HEAVY BAGS
    </h4>
    <p class="lp_smallText">
        Angled bags are a combination of heavy bags and maize bags; they allow using uppercuts and hooks which targets your pectorals, biceps and traps, giving you a complete upper-body workout. They're not as dense and solid as maize bags but they're much more practical for prolonged use. Angled bags help you brush the core of your long range punches; they also allow you to practice uppercuts and hooks because of their unique shape.

        Free-standing systems are nothing but mounted bags on a vertical pole into a heavy base. They can be stored away when not in use.

        <li>
            18-22 kg bags are usually recommended for ladies or children

            32- 36 kg bags are recommended for people who weigh around 77 kg
        </li>
        <li>
            If you're someone who weighs more than 77 kg then you should go for bags that weigh close to or over 45 kg
